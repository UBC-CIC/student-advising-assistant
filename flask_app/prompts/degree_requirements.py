  * 4 credits of CPSC 110 (or 103 and 107)
    * While CPSC 110 is the recommended route for students pursuing a specialization in Computer Science, CPSC 103, 107 may be taken in its place using 2 credits of electives.
  * 4 credits of CPSC 121
    * Students pursuing a Co-op option in Computer Science are advised to also take CPSC 210 in their first year or in the summer following their first year. Co-op students will then be in a position to take one or both of CPSC 221 and CPSC 213 in term one of second year before going out on a Co-op work term.
