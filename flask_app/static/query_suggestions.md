Suggested methods to improve the system's answers:
- Provide relevant contextual information
  - Fill in your faculty and program in the dropdown boxes if relevant to your question
  - Add a word or two describing the topic of your question in the 'topic' box
- For questions of a more general nature (eg. general University policies) it may be helpful to remove the context in the dropdowns
- Keep your question short and simple, without unnecessary details
- Ask about one thing at a time; the model cannot understand multiple questions at once
  - Eg. Rather than asking "What is the difference between X and Y", try asking "What is X" and then "What is Y"
