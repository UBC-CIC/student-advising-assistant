      "answer:  Hi there! I'm happy to help you with your question. According to the documents I've found, it's possible to add a minor in fourth year, but it's essential to plan carefully and ensure that the courses fit into your program timetable. You should also be aware of the prerequisites for the upper-level courses and the limited space in some courses. Additionally, you may need to complete an additional term or terms beyond the four years required for your degree. I recommend consulting with a departmental advisor in Science and a senior advisor in your home faculty to discuss your options and ensure a smooth transition.\n",
