**Note**: [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) is the official Infrastructure-as-Code toolchain by AWS that provision cloud resources with CloudFormation behind the scene. When we say "provisioned by AWS CDK", it means that the creation of the resources and their specifications is handled by CDK behind the scene according to CDK's default best practice criteria/workflows.
